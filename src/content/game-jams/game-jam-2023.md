The Annual Game Jam 2023 was a blast! Last year was so successful we decided to make it an ongoing thing. With X participants in this year's turnout, the final theme was *theme here*. *something about how the themes were chosen*. *something about the games that were submitted. *something unique to this event that happened*.

Many thanks to our  our sponsors, X and Y.
