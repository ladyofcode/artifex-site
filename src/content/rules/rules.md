# Rules

## Registration and teams

- Who can join? Anyone! Regardless of experience level.
- You must stick to the team size requirements that will be announced on
  the team forming night. There will be a minimum of 2 members in a
  team, **no solo submissions.**
- Only one person from each team is required to submit the game, but you
  can add additional teammates who have itch.io profiles from the More \> admins heading under the game project.

- **It is NOT recommended to join more than 1 team.**

## Jam submission rules

- You may use any game engine/framework/language to make your game.

- **No submissions that require external games or software (i.e.
  Roblox)**

- **Your submission must ideally run on web,** and most computers with
  low-mid end specs. Otherwise your submission can be created for
  Windows, however **if running on Windows you must bring your own
  device to demo your game**, i.e. a laptop with your game
  pre-installed.

## Content and crediting rules

- You are allowed to create games featuring mature content such as
  violence and sexual themes, but you **MUST disclose this in a content
  warning on your submission page** and tag +18 in the title of your
  game and the game thumbnail.

- **You may not make NFT games**. Games that are monetized by or
  affiliated with NFTs or cryptocurrencies will be banned.

- **Using AI generated art (Dalle, Midjourney) for assets or images is
  NOT allowed** due to copyright concerns. Games with AI generated art
  will be disqualified and removed from the jam.

- You may use AI generated text (ChatGPT) for ideas and code generation.

- **You may use third party resources in your game if you have the legal
  rights to use them**.

- To credit resources in either the game credits or the game's itch.io
  page, state the resource and the creator's name and link. (i.e., Art
  by cool_artist)

- You can use pre-existing code and libraries you have the rights to
  use, including your own. However, anything specific to this jam game
  should be created within the jam timeframe.

## Legal and payment rules

- You retain all rights to your game and are free to sell it even after
  the jam has ended.

- You do not have to pay to join or submit to the jam, however note that
  some game development tools cost money (but there are plenty of free
  options).

## Look after yourself and Have Fun

This jam is about creating positive experiences and connecting with
people from across both societies. It\'s not about crunch and
competition. Remember to stay hydrated, eat good food, move around, take
rest breaks, and give yourself enough time to get plenty of sleep each
night. For more tips on looking after your mental health at a game jam,
check out this link from Global Game Jam: [Looking after your mental
health at GGJ](https://v3.globalgamejam.org/news/looking-after-your-mental-health-ggj)

Look out for each other, learn, create together and have fun. This game
jam isn't just about making games; it\'s also for creating friendships,
connections, experiences, and memories.

  gender, race, religion, ability, or sexuality

  spaces, including names, icons, and bios

**I will engage respectfully with others. I will hold myself and other
jammers accountable to the following:**

  Avoid putting down others whether talking about your own or others'
  work.

  servers and in-person events.

  interacting with other jammers. If someone approaches you in a way
  that makes you uncomfortable or unsafe, please get in contact with a
  jam host.

**I understand there are consequences for not following the code of
conduct**

- **Violation or debate (including jokes, sarcasm, and bad-faith
  arguments) of the code of conduct** will result in being removed from
  the game jam and its respective communities.

- **Contacting hosts or moderators on personal accounts** to contest
  warnings, mutes, or bans is considered harassment and will result in a
  block and permanent ban. If you have honest reason to believe there
  was a misunderstanding, contact us through
