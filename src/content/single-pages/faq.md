## Am I allowed to form a solo team?
No, solo entries will not be accepted as an official submission and will not be qualified to receive any prizes.

## Am I allowed to form a team with members who are not from ANU?
Only on a case-by-case basis. If you want to bring in a member from outside of the ANU community please first seek permission from a Game Jam organiser. 

## Can my team exceed 5 members?
No. Teams much bigger than 5 members tend to be harder to manage, and the maximum member cap is decided by a fair division of the prize money.

## What software can I use to make my game?
You can use any game engine/framework/language that allows you to export your game in either a WebGL or exe format. WebGL is highly recommended as it makes your game easier to demo directly on the browser on Itch.io. Please see Itch.io's documentation for more details on how to upload games to the platform.

## Can I use Roblox or another game editor to create my game?
No, games with level editors such as Roblox, Gmod, Fortnite, etc. are not permitted in this jam.

## Can my game be physical, ie. a card game or board game?
No, this jam is created to focus on digital forms of media. However, if your game requires a phyisical "prop" or controller ie. 3D glasses, custom controller, etc. then that is allowed as long as the team is able to create or source these items themselves.

## Do all my team members need to make an Itch.io account for submission?
No, only 1 person in the team needs to submit the game, but it is recommended for team members to all make accounts in order to all be able to vote.

## Can I use generative AI in my game?
No for art, design, music and writing. Yes for coding assistance and ideas. Along with the dubious copyright issues surrounding AI generation in the current climate, the point of this jam is to connect programmers with artists and create new things together. Games with AI generated art will be disqualified and removed from the jam. You may use AI generated text for ideas and code generation.

## Can I use assets and tools I have made previously?
Yes, as long as you have the right to use these assets and tools you are allowed to use your own asset & code libraries.

## Do I need to rate every entry?
Yes, please take the time on Demos Night to give a rating on every game in the submissions tab. Doing this makes sure that the final outcome of the votes is fair and balanced.

## Do I need to have an Itch.io account to rate entries?
Yes, the Game Jam submission ratings are locked to game contributors (ie. anyone who submitted, or contributed to a submission). This is to prevent rating tampering. To become a Contributor the person who submitted the game needs to add you through your game project, this is done by going to More > Admins, entering the username of the person you want to add and clicking "Add Admin", and following the instructions onscreen. For more details on how to do this please see the Jam community forms.
